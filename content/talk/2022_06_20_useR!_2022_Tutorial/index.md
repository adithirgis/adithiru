title: Introduction to spatial data analysis in R
---


## Abstract

R serves as an excellent open-source platform to perform various spatial analyses. With recent developments in packages that can handle large data sets in little time like `sf` and `terra`, spatial data wrangling and modeling have also become simple.

This tutorial is for R users who are familiar with basic data wrangling in R but are new to spatial analysis. We will introduce various spatial data types, and a few basic R packages used to download and analyze spatial data, such as `sf` and `raster`, using `tidyverse` style. Participants will learn how to transform spatial data (focusing on raster and vector data) to different projections, create buffers of different radii and extract information. We will extract points from a raster, calculate distance and area, perform spatial joins, and derive a summary of raster images. We will explore the conversion of raster to vector data and vice-versa. Finally, we will create static and interactive maps. We will also share other resources that will help participants continue their learning journey.
