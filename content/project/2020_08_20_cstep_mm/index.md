## Executive Summary

Stationary air-quality monitoring is a common component of understanding air-pollution; however, monitoring at one location fails to capture local variations in pollutant concentrations. In locations where emissions and concentrations exhibit fine-scale spatial variability, including in urban environments in India, characterising spatial variability can be helpful for understanding sources and potential solutions for air-pollution. 'Mobile monitors', that is, sensors installed on a mobile platform, have been used as a new approach across the world, by cities and governments to complement their existing stationary monitoring networks. 

This report summarises the outputs of an 11-month-long mobile-monitoring project with a goal to produce a high-resolution pollution map of select parts of Bengaluru. The aim of this project was also to study the contrast in urban areas and examine if these contrasts are reflected in measured pollutant concentrations. The data thus collected will help in building and validating predictive models in the future. A custom-built mobile platform, comprising a CNG car equipped with air-pollution instrumentation, was used in the study. Our route of study included a central business district (CBD), a residential urban neighbourhood, a peri-urban neighbourhood, and an
urban-rural transect. In the entire project, the study route was surveyed about 27 times (~6000 km of driving). 

During the study period, nearly a million 1-second measurements of each of the pollutants were made. Overall, large spatial gradients were observed in on-road pollutant concentrations. Major roads had the highest pollutant levels, followed by arterials and residential roads. Among individual pollutants, black carbon (BC) and ultrafine particles (UFPs) were characterised with large spatio-temporal variations, compared with that of PM~2.5~ (a criteria pollutant). 

The on-road BC and PM~2.5~ are several times higher than ambient levels. Additionally, PM~2.5~ over the major roads is always higher than the prescribed national standards. Not surprisingly, the urban residential neighbourhood was characterised by relatively low levels of on-road pollution (PM~2.5~ values were the lowest there). Similarly, BC and UFPs were the lowest in residential
neighbourhoods (urban and peri-urban), followed by arterials and major roads. All of the measured pollutants peaked at different locations along the study route. While UFPs peaked in the central business district characterised by commercial activity, BC and PM~2.5~ peaked away from the city centre, along major roads.


The study investigated the feasibility of mobile-monitoring studies in middle-income countries, which often have poor road conditions (making such measurement campaigns challenging), high background pollution levels, and heterogeneous sources of pollution. This project has demonstrated that this approach is feasible and leads to reliable estimates of street-level exposure. This approach can be tailored to study specific sources or regions and zoom in to identify hotspots that may be prioritised for policy interventions. The next steps would be to scale this approach in a way that best suits the needs of local policymakers.
