title: Best Practices for Deploying and Maintaining a Low-Cost PM~2.5~ Sensor Network
---

## Abstract

Strategically placed sensors can monitor air pollution and provide a detailed picture of air quality and its variability within a region. Low-cost sensors (LCSs) that measure PM~2.5~ are becoming increasingly popular because of their low cost, ease of use, and portability. However, the portability and low cost come with trade-offs on data quality, reliability, and shelf life. The typical shelf life of LCSs is around a year to two. Also, the raw data from these LCSs need to be calibrated. This report documents the best practices for establishing and maintaining an LCS network.
