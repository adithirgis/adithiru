## Introduction

The elephants in southern India are found in 7 states, predominantly in forested hilly tracks of the Western Ghats and its adjacent Eastern Ghats in the states of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and also as small numbers and population in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Goa. Of all the elephants in the country, Karnataka harbors the highest number of elephants. The typography, climate, vegetation and natural water resources of Karnataka shape this into a distinctive elephant region. The combination scrub, dry and moist deciduous forests provide substantial and suitable foliage, shade and other ecological requirements to the elephants. Elephants are found in 32 Forest divisions, estimating a total of 6049 elephants for the state. 

However, a comprehensive mapping of elephant distribution in Karnataka, their movement routes and corridors is essential. This would help in identifying the actual area available to them to meet their ecological requirements in the state. This publication "Atlas: Elephants of Karnataka - status, distribution, movements and corridors", for the first time ever, illustrates GIS based maps of elephant distribution, known routes and corridors and potential habitat links used by Asian elephants in Karnataka.
