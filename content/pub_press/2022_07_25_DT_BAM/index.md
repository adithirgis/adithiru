title: Bias in PM2.5 measurements using collocated reference-grade and optical instruments

## Abstract

Optical PM2.5 measurements are sensitive to aerosol properties that can vary with space and time. Here, we compared PM2.5 measurements from collocated reference-grade (beta attenuation monitors, BAMs) and optical instruments (two DustTrak II and two DustTrak DRX) over 6 months. We performed inter-model (two different models), intra-model (two units of the same model), and inter-type (two different device types: optical vs. reference-grade) comparisons under ambient conditions. Averaged over our study period, PM2.5 measured concentrations were 46.0 and 45.5 ??g m???3 for the two DustTrak II units, 29.8 and 38.4 ??g m???3 for DRX units, and 18.3 and 19.0 ??g m???3 for BAMs. The normalized root square difference (NRMSD; compares PM2.5 measurements from paired instruments of the same type) was ~5% (DustTrak II), ~27% (DRX), and ~15% (BAM). The normalized root mean square error (NRMSE; compares PM2.5 measurements from optical instruments against a reference instrument) was ~165% for DustTrak II, ~74% after applying literature-based humidity correction and ~27% after applying both the humidity and BAM corrections. Although optical instruments are highly precise in their PM2.5 measurements, they tend to be strongly biased relative to reference-grade devices. We also explored two different methods to compensate for relative humidity bias and found that the results differed by ~50% between the two methods. This study highlights the limitations of adopting a literature-derived calibration equation and the need for conducting local model-specific calibration. Moreover, this is one of the few studies to perform an intra-model comparison of collocated reference-grade devices.
