  I am a Research Software Engineer for my team at [ILK Labs](https://www.ilklabs.com/). My work involves building analysing data to understand environmental issues. I have become a data enthusiast lately. Since I have heavily benefited from the community my other focus areas are community outreach and open science. 
  
  I am the co-founder and co-organiser of [R-Ladies Bengaluru](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBLR), and also participate in book clubs organised by [R4DS book club](https://twitter.com/R4DScommunity). I was a part of the Global organising team for Sponsorship, Program and Content and Code of Conduct Response team for the [useR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/about/global-team/) and for [user! 2022](https://user2022.r-project.org/about/organizers/) as well.    

  When not working with R communities I sometimes volunteer for [Bangpypers](https://bangalore.pythonindia.org/) (Bangalore Python users' group) to find speakers. 
  
  I am a peer reviewer for [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@adithirgis) and [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/418#issuecomment-995521139).
  
  I have conducted an incubator on Strategies to build a strong [Asia R community at useR! 2021](https://twitter.com/janani137/status/1412621919392874499), [Janani Ravi](https://jravilab.github.io/) and I are working towards it, please contact us at [adithiru095@gmail.com]() to join or know more. 
  
  I co-hosted a live Q and A session - Teaching for [rstudio::global(2021)](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/?category_ids=1753-teaching) and was the chair for Keynote at [useR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/join/).
  
  Recently at useR! 2022 my team and I also gave a tutorial on [Introduction to spatial data analysis in R](https://user2022.r-project.org/program/tutorials/#introduction-to-spatial-data-analysis-in-r). The video can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-PhVnFVFyc)
  
  Though I speak only a few programming languages, in social life I can speak English, Hindi, Kannada, Tulu, Tamil, Telugu and I can understand Marathi.
