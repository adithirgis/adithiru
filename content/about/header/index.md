  Hello World!
---

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Research Assistant at the University of Liverpool and data science consultant based in Leeds, UK. I have a Masters in Geoinformatics and a Bachelors in Physics. I have been working on mobile monitoring of air quality in specific routes in India and predicting air quality in Sub-Saharan Africa using different statistical and machine learning models to air quality sensor data. I like making things simpler and automating analysis. I am a certified [Tidyverse Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/upadhya+adithi/).  

I started out with C++ while in high school and slowly moved to C and C# during Bachelors and Masters respectively. I started to use R to automate analysis for a bunch of satellite images and never turned back. I continuously use Python or R at work to make numbers easy to understand. I also use QGIS to make high resolution spatial maps. 

The community has played a key role in making my coding journey smooth. I love to learn new tips to make codes simpler, understand complex science in a simple way and my favourite way to spend time is writing functions.

I am a proud alumna of [Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning](https://www.sssihl.edu.in/). After my coding and science hours you can find my head behind my kindle or trying to learn a new language or volunteering at a local meditation center. I am an amateur runner and a trained classical [Bharatnatyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatanatyam) dancer.
