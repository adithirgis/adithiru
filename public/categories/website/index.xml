      <description>I have been wanting to make a personal website forever, but I am also a person who is super bad with colour combinations, beautification of stuff. So I kept pushing this, till I stumbled on Dr. Silvia Canelï¿½n&amp;rsquo;s website. I directly contacted her and she was very nice and sweet to help me out throughout this. This website has been heavily inspired by Silvia&amp;rsquo;s.
Why website(s)So, in the beginning of this year (2021), I was got selected for the rstudio::global(2021) Diversity Scholarship to attend two workshops.</description>
