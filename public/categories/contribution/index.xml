      <description>I started my journey with the community in 2020. Somehow the pandemic year really helped me to reach out to people. I always admired the people who were deeply involved in community or volunteering work. I never could fathom how they could make time and space for all the amazing work they do.
There is one significant incident which actually brought me in touch with the kind community. I attended my first R Ladies virtual event, at 4 am in the morning (IST), where Dorris Scott taught us how to make website and BAM in 2 hours by 6 am in the morning here in India I had a personal website which was way above my expectations.</description>
