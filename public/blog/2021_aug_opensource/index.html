        <p>I started my journey with the community in 2020. Somehow the pandemic year really helped me to reach out to people. I always admired the people who were deeply involved in community or volunteering work. I never could fathom how they could make time and space for all the amazing work they do.</p>
<p>There is one significant incident which actually brought me in touch with the kind community. I attended my first 
<a href="https://rladies.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R Ladies</a> virtual event, at 4 am in the morning (IST), where 
<a href="https://twitter.com/Dorris_Scott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dorris Scott</a> taught us how to make website and <strong>BAM</strong> in 2 hours by 6 am in the morning here in India I had a 
<a href="https://adithirgis.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal website</a> which was way above my expectations. I was so satisfied with the outcome and the power of community learning and hand holding. I thought if I could build a website at 4 am in the morning, imagine what I could have done at 9 am (kidding, probably I would have added more content). So I checked for R Ladies local chapters here in Bangalore, India. I found that the chapter never started.</p>
<p>I have a very good friend from college 
<a href="https://twitter.com/_Deepthi_R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deepthi</a>, a very amazing colleague 
<a href="https://twitter.com/Saumya8singh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saumya</a> and a friend 
<a href="https://twitter.com/anupamal14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anupama</a>, who was also equally excited to start a Bangalore Chapter when we had met at a conference.</p>
<p>We quickly gathered the information required to start a chapter, and from then on conduct regular meet ups every month, hoping that people like me and I myself are benefited highly by these short power meet ups. You can check out the amazing speakers and topics 
<a href="https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_bangalore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our chapter has hosted</a>.</p>
<p>Once I got a taste of volunteering and organising, I could not stop. I think the way I have benefited from the community, I feel volunteering is my very very small bit to give back.</p>
<p>I also got an opportunity to be a part of a 
<a href="https://user2021.r-project.org/about/global-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global conference</a> because of Bangalore chapter.</p>
<p>Once I started volunteering for organising etc, I got some confidence in contributing to open source software as well. I have taken baby steps like fixing typos, and also somehow took the courage to do some major coding stuff.</p>
<p>This year, since I am involved in R communities, I have started to give some time for 
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/bangpypers/people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python communities</a> as well. If I have evolved so much with R communities and the kind humans, I am sure I will be welcomed there too.</p>
<p>So, why volunteering? For me, it would always be because I grow, I learn, I meet people around the world, I sleep peacefully. Sometimes it is difficult to find time, but I always remember all the super humans who contribute, they do it, so, I atleast can try.</p>

<p>This piece is a tribute to all who have helped me knowingly or unknowingly. Each one of you all have supported me.</p>
