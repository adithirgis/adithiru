      <description>AbstractStrategically placed sensors can monitor air pollution and provide a detailed picture of air quality and its variability within a region.

However, the portability and low cost come with trade-offs on data quality, reliability, and shelf life. The typical shelf life of LCSs is around a year to two.</description>
